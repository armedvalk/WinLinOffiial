# CodeDump
In boredom I decided to code a full tool to harden windows and linux systems. 
--------
# Special thanks
The hardening scripts I am using are not mine, I owe all to them.

# How It Works
it will first ask you for the directory that you wish to scan, becuase this is a open source and free project, I ask that the directory has no more than 90 files.
After that the app will detect your OS and run a script accordingly.
